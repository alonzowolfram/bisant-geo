# File structure
Results folders generated from a `bisantine-geo` pipeline run and stored in the `out` folder (or the folder specified in `bisantine-geo/config.yaml`) are structured as follows:

* `./`
    - `config`
        - `config.yaml`
        - `conda.env`
    - `logs`
        - ...
    - `pubs`
        - `{PowerPoint_file_name}.pptx` 
    - `Rdata`
        - ...
    - `tabular`
        - ...

# Details
`config`: For reproducibility and record-keeping purposes, the pipeline freezes the conda environment it is run in as well as the experimental settings for the run and saves them as YAML files.

* `config.yaml`: <br /> 
A file with all the settings used for the `bisantine-geo` run.
<br />
<br />

* `conda.env`: <br />
A file containing the conda environment in which the pipeline was run. 
<br />
<br />

`logs`: Files containing the stderr and stdout output from the scripts in the pipeline. 
<br />
<br />

`pubs`: Publications generated by the pipeline. These include PowerPoints and (in future versions) HTML/PDF/Word reports.
* `{PowerPoint_file_name}.rds`: <br />
A PowerPoint file generated as part of a `bisantine-geo` run. 
<br />
<br />

`Rdata`: `.rds` files generated by the pipeline.
* `{raw_NanoStringGeoMxSet_file_name}.rds`: A file containing the NanoStringGeoMxSet object from different stages in the pipeline.
<br />
<br />

`tabular`: Outputs in tabular format (Excel, CSV, TSV, etc.) generated by the pipeline.
