  lmm:

    # In this section there are four parameters for running linear mixed models (LMMs).
    # You can specify multiple experiments, as follows:
    # let's say you wanted to run two LMMs, 
    # the first: uses a random slope, 
    #   the test variable is named `Region` in the annotation, 
    #   the random intercept is the column `Sample ID` in the annotation,
    #   and the random slope is also `Region`;
    # the second: does NOT use a random slope,
    #   the test variable is named `Tissue Type` in the annotation,
    #   and the random intercept is `Sample ID`.
    # then you would fill out the four variables as follows:
    #
    # random_slope: yes,no
    # test_vars: Region,Tissue Type
    # random_intercept_vars: Sample ID,Sample ID
    # random_slope_vars: Region,NA

    # !-- As of v0.2.0, random_slope_vars is deprecated for the following reason:

    # (see https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/GeoMxWorkflows/inst/doc/GeomxTools_RNA-NGS_Analysis.html)."
    # [Required] The column name(s) in the sample annotation (given by {sample_annotation_file}) corresponding to

    # and an LFC > 1, you'd enter 0.05,1
    # If only one value is provided, it will be treated as the FDR.
